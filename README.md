# Attendify üì∏

Attendify is a Facial Recognition Attendance System built using Python, OpenCV (cv2), face_recognition, and Firebase for real-time database integration. This application allows the registration of students with their photos, encodes the facial features, and marks attendance by recognizing the student's face in real-time.
